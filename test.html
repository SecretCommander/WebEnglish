  <h1>Subject-Verb Agreement Rules</h1>

  <div class="container">

    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Adding '-s' to Verbs in Present Tense</h3>
      <p>In Simple Present Tense, for third-person singular subjects (he, she, it, or singular nouns), the verb takes '-s' or '-es'. For plural subjects (and I, you, we, they), the base form is used.</p>
      <div class="examples">
Singular Subject + Singular Verb:
- The boy runs quickly. (Not 'run')
- She sings beautifully. (Not 'sing')
- My mother cooks dinner every night. (Not 'cook')
- This book contains interesting stories. (Not 'contain')

Plural Subject + Plural Verb:
- The boys run quickly. (Not 'runs')
- They sing beautifully. (Not 'sings')
- My parents cook dinner every night. (Not 'cooks')
- These books contain interesting stories. (Not 'contains')
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. Using 'To Be' (Am, Is, Are, Was, Were)</h3>
      <p>The verb 'to be' changes depending on the subject and tense.</p>
      <div class="examples">
Present Tense:
- I am a student.
- He/She/It is happy.
- The cat is sleeping.
- My brother is tall.
- We/You/They are friends.
- The cats are sleeping.
- My brothers are tall.

Past Tense:
- I/He/She/It was there.
- The dog was barking.
- That day was hot.
- We/You/They were tired.
- The dogs were barking.
- Those days were hot.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Using 'To Have' (Has, Have)</h3>
      <p>The verb 'have' also changes depending on the subject in the present tense, but 'had' is used for all subjects in the past.</p>
      <div class="examples">
Present Tense:
- I/You/We/They have a car.
- The students have completed their assignments.
- He/She/It has a car.
- My sister has completed her assignment.

Past Tense:
- All the students had finished.
- The teacher had explained everything.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Prepositional Phrases Between Subject and Verb</h3>
      <p>When a prepositional phrase comes between the subject and the verb, the verb must agree with the subject, not the noun in the phrase.</p>
      <div class="examples">
- The box of chocolates is on the table. (Not 'are')
- The student with all the books is very smart. (Not 'are')
- The flowers in the vase are beautiful. (Not 'is')
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>5. Nouns Joined by 'And'</h3>
      <p>When two or more subjects are joined by 'and', they usually take a plural verb.</p>
      <div class="examples">
- John and Mary are going to the party.
- A pen and a pencil are needed for the test.
- The dog and the cat sleep in the same bed.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>6. Nouns Joined by 'Or' or 'Nor'</h3>
      <p>When subjects are joined by 'or' or 'nor', the verb agrees with the subject closest to it.</p>
      <div class="examples">
- Either John or Mary is responsible.
- Neither the students nor the teacher is ready.
- Neither the teacher nor the students are ready.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>7. Indefinite Pronouns</h3>
      <p>Some are always singular, some always plural, and some depend on the context.</p>
      <div class="examples">
Always Singular:
- Everyone is here.
- Each of the students has a book.
- Nobody knows the answer.

Always Plural:
- Both of them are coming.
- Many believe in ghosts.

Singular or Plural Based on Context:
- All of the cake is eaten.
- All of the cookies are eaten.
- Some of the water is spilled.
- Some of the students are absent.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>8. Collective Nouns</h3>
      <p>Collective nouns can be singular or plural depending on whether the group acts as one or as individuals.</p>
      <div class="examples">
As a Single Unit (Singular):
- The team is ready for the game.
- My family is going on vacation.

As Individuals (Plural - esp. in British English):
- The team are arguing among themselves.
- My family are discussing their plans.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>9. Always Plural Nouns</h3>
      <p>Some nouns are always plural, even if they refer to one item with two parts or groups of people.</p>
      <div class="examples">
- The scissors are on the table.
- My trousers are too long.
- The police are investigating the case.
- His data are accurate.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>10. Singular-Looking but Plural Nouns</h3>
      <p>Some nouns end in '-s' but are treated as singular grammatically.</p>
      <div class="examples">
- What news is there?
- Mathematics is my favorite subject.
- Measles is a contagious disease.
- The United States is a large country.
